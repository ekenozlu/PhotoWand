# PhotoWand
In this demo app I created a photo manipulating application on Swift with Storyboard.

## App Contains:
1. Slider to adjust filter on the image
2. Alert List of different filters to adjust on photo

## In this demo app I used and practiced:
1. UIImagePicker, Saving Image
2. CoreImage, CIFilters
3. UIKit and Storyboard

## Currently Working on
1. Bug fixing
2. Creating a better UI (Horizontal Button List for each filter)
3. Add Label for Slider Values
4. Hold Function to see the original image
