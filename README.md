# PhotoWand
In this demo app I created a photo manipulating application on Swift with Storyboard.

## App Contains:
1. Slider to adjust filter on the image
2. Horizontal Button List for different filters
3. Multiple filters on single image
4. Hold function to the edited image to see the original image
5. Indicator on button list to show which one is in usage
6. Successfully saving to Photo Library

## In this demo app I used and practiced:
1. UIImagePicker, Saving Image
2. CoreImage, CIFilters
3. CollectionView
4. UIKit and Storyboard

## Currently Working on
1. Bug fixing
2. Effects with multiple sliders
