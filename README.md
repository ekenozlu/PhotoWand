# PhotoWand
In this demo app I created a photo manipulating application on Swift with Storyboard.

## App Contains:
1. Slider to adjust filter on the image
2. Horizontal Button List for different filters
3. Currently one filter for image (working on it)

## In this demo app I used and practiced:
1. UIImagePicker, Saving Image
2. CoreImage, CIFilters
3. CollectionView
4. UIKit and Storyboard

## Currently Working on
1. Bug fixing
2. Hold function to the edited image to see the original image
3. Effects with multiple sliders
4. Multiple filters on single Image

Note:Photos are
