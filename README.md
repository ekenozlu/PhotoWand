# PhotoWand
In this demo app I created a photo manipulating application on Swift with Storyboard.

## App Contains:
1. Slider to adjust filter on the image
2. Horizontal Button List for different filters
3. Multiple filters on single image
4. Successfully saving to Photo Library

## In this demo app I used and practiced:
1. UIImagePicker, Saving Image
2. CoreImage, CIFilters
3. CollectionView
4. UIKit and Storyboard

## Currently Working on
1. Bug fixing
2. Hold function to the edited image to see the original image
3. Effects with multiple sliders
4. Change on filter labels to indicate which one is in usage
